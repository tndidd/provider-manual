### Development

This manual was developed by staff of the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (DIDD). Many stakeholders, including providers of all types, provider organizations, people who use DIDD services, family members and advocacy organizations, were involved in the development and review of this manual. We extend our sincere thanks for their patience and willingness to devote time and energy to the completion of the Provider Manual.
