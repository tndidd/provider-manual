## Development, Update and Distribution

---

###Development 
This manual was developed by staff of the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (DIDD). 

Many stakeholders, including providers of all types, provider organizations, people who use DIDD services, family members and advocacy organizations, were involved in the development and review of this manual. We extend our sincere thanks for their patience and willingness to devote time and energy to the completion of the Provider Manual. 


> This version of the Provider Manual supersedes all previous provider manuals. 

* Additional details regarding DIDD policies and procedures are available on the DIDD [website](http://tn.gov/didd). 
* Any TennCare policies that have been distributed by DIDD pertaining to Medicaid Waiver programs continue to be applicable to waiver service providers.


### Update
The provider manual will be updated as needed to communicate changes in policy and program requirements. Changes in provider requirements that result in manual updates will require a public meeting and fiscal impact statement of applicable manual sections as required by state law. Providers will be notified of updates through official written correspondence.

### Distribution
Primary responsibility for distribution of the manual and manual updates will rest with the Office of Policy and Innovation, Policy Division within DIDD. Printable copies will be available through the DIDD web site in **PDF**, **ePub** and **Mobi** formats as well as being available in a web version.
