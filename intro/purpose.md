### Purpose

---

#### Basics

The purpose of this manual is to outline the basic principles and requirements for delivery of quality services to persons with intellectual disabilities. All providers who participate in state- and federally -funded service delivery programs must have an executed provider agreement which requires compliance with this manual. Some sections of the manual apply to all providers, whereas other sections refer to specific types of providers.

#### Provider Resources

There is information throughout the manual which references additional provider resources such as state and federal statutes, rules and regulations; other tools and manuals; and web sites. These types of materials are available to assist providers in the development of policies and practices that meet the requirements specified in this manual and promote a good system of service delivery.

#### Relationships with People Using Services

For the purposes of this manual, people supported by DIDD programs may be referred to as people using services, person(s) supported, or person. These terms will be used in place of previously accepted terminology such as waiver participant, waiver enrollee, service recipient, client, member, consumer, or patient.

People using services are the most important stakeholders in the system. It is essential that providers have the ability to develop and maintain effective working relationships with the people using their services, their families, their legal representatives, and their advocates who may assist them in exercising their rights. Information in the manual outlines requirements and resources intended to promote respectful, effective relationships between the person (and those assisting or representing them) and the providers delivering the services.

#### Relationships with Other Providers of Services and Supports

Information included in the manual is intended to assist providers in developing relationships with other types of providers, and in accessing and maximizing resources available through other programs available within the state. This information is intended to promote the ideal that people who participate in different programs must be treated in a holistic manner. In other words, the programs described in this manual will not meet all the social and health-care needs of persons with intellectual disabilities. It is essential that providers develop an understanding of how the services available through these programs fit within the broader system of state healthcare, educational, and social programs. Effective integration of services offered through the programs described in this manual with external services and natural supports is a goal that the state will continue to work toward.
