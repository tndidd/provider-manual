### Welcome!

Thank you for your participation in the Tennessee service delivery system for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The development of an adequate provider network with focus on quality and cost effective services for people with disabilities is a priority for the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

The provider manual was revised with input from individuals receiving services, stakeholders, providers, DIDD staff, and the Bureau of TennCare. DIDD appreciates the feedback we received to make changes and improvements to the manual.

It is important to note that this manual does not encompass all provider requirements. This manual, as well as policies and provider agreements, are all necessary elements of operating a quality provider network. As the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities embarks on further improving person centered practices, individual choice, and obtaining accreditation through the Council on Quality Leadership this manual, as well as other policies, will be updated to reflect progress towards those efforts.

DIDD, providers, and stakeholders are partners in a common goal to provide quality, person-centered and cost effective services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live fulfilling and rewarding lives.

Sincerely,

Debra K. Payne
Commissioner, DIDD
